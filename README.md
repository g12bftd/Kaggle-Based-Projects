A few of my projects.


# 1) Breast Cancer Classification (SVC)

Objective: Given features regarding breast tumors, we wish to classify these tumors as either benign or malignant

30 features are used, examples include:
radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features Number of Instances: 569 Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign Target class:
Malignant
Benign https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

Using Support Vector Classification, we build a model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

# 2) Customer Subscription Behavior Analysis

We are working for a fintech company that wants to provide customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track their finances.
To attract customers, the company releases a free version of the app.
The task is to identify which users will most likely NOT purchase the paid version of the app, so that additional offers can be provided to them. Accuracy is key, because increased targeted advertising is costly.

Our dataset features:
User ID
Day and time at which the user first opened the app
Day of the week (numerical) at which the user first opened the app
Hour of the day at which the user first opened the app
User age
Screen list: every screen name visited by user in the app
Number of screens visited in the app by the user
Whether the user played the available minigame
Whether the user gave a "like" rating to the app
Whether the user used the app's premium feature
Whether the user enrolled in the paid product
The date of enrolment (if any)

Using Logistic Regression, we build a model to predict whether a customer has enrolled in the app's paid version.

# 3) Fashion Class Classification

Given a series of images, we want to build a machine learning model that is able to identify the fashion content of each image. Examples of classes include shorts, bags, dresses etc.

This is a simpler, smaller version of the Amazon Echo Look Style Assistant.
Applications could have real life benefits. By idenitifying most liked images on social media platforms, we could provide targeted advertisements that stay on top of fashion trends.

Our dataset will contain 70, 000 images:
60,000 for training
10, 000 for testing
Images are 28 x 28 grayscale
There will be 10 target output classes.

A note on greyscale:
System of 256 tones ranging from 0-255
0 represents black and 255 represents white
Therefore, each image will be represented by a row of 28x28 = 784 values to encode its grayscale values.

Detailed dataset info from Kaggle:
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot

Using a convolutional neural network, we predict which of the 10 items of fashion feature in any given image.
